			     Booting Pintos
			     ==============

---- QUESTIONS ---- 
>> Put the screenshots of Pintos running in src/p0.
>> A1: Is there any particular issue that you would like us to know?

			     Debugging
			     =========

---- QUESTIONS: BIOS ---- 
>> B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?
[f000:fff0]    0xffff0: ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b

>> B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?
0xffff0

>> B3: Can you guess why the first instruction is like this?
This first instruction is likely hard-wired to the BIOS ROM, and is responsible
for passing control to the boot loader. The BIOS has just loaded the 512-byte 
boot sector into physical memory starting at f000:fff0, and must jump the 
instruction pointer to allow the boot loader to begin executing its code.

Why ljmp? What are we comparing here?

>> B4: What are the next three instructions?
[f000:e05b]    0xfe05b: cmpw   $0x28,%cs:(%esi)
[f000:e062]    0xfe062: jne    0xd241d0ad
[f000:e066]    0xfe066: xor    %edx,%edx

---- QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER ---- 
>> B5: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt
is used?
The bootloader reads disk sectors one at a time, checking each time if it needs to proceed 
to the next drive or partition and iterating through partition table entries by incrementing 
%rsi. The bootloader will skip over drives that do not have an MBR signature, and partitions that 
are either unused or do not belong to the Pintos kernel. The BIOS system call interrupt "read_sector" 
is used to read the disks.

>> B6: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?
The bootloader decides it successfully finds the Pintos kernel when it reaches drive 0x80, 
as indicated by %es:(%si). It then jumps to a function that loads the kernel.

>> B7: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?
If the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel, it prints "Not found" and notifies the 
BIOS that the boot failed via instruction "int $0x18".

>> B8: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?
The bootloader transfers control to the Pintos kernel after it successfully reads all kernel sectors. 
It reads the start address of the kernel from its ELF header and stores it in memory in segment:offset 
format. It then jumps to the stored address after dereferencing the pointer to memory, which is necessary 
because 80x86 doesn't support jumping to locations stored in this format (potentially across multiple registers).

---- QUESTIONS: KERNEL ---- 
>> B9: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression 
init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

>> B10: When palloc_get_page() is called for the first time,

>> B10.1 what does the call stack look like?

>> B10.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?

>> B10.3 what is the value of expression init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

>> B11: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B11.1 what does the call stack look like?

>> B11.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?

>> B11.3 what is the value of expression init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?

			     Kernel Monitor
			     ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----
>> C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.

>> C3: Any additional enhancement you implement?
